# Logical Sequence of Mathematical Methods

## 1. Initial Stock Filtering
Start by applying basic financial ratios to filter out stocks that do not meet key criteria.  
Liquidity Ratios (Current Ratio, Quick Ratio): Ensure the company has enough assets to cover its short-term liabilities.  
Leverage Ratios (Debt-to-Equity, Interest Coverage): Filter for financially stable companies with manageable debt levels.  
Profitability Ratios (ROE, ROA, Gross Margin): Select companies with a solid track record of profitability.  

2. Risk and Volatility Assessment  
After filtering by ratios, assess the risk associated with the stocks.

# Detailed Breakdown of Mathematical Methods

## 1. Initial Stock Filtering: Financial Ratios
Start by filtering stocks based on financial health, focusing on liquidity, leverage, and profitability. These basic filters will ensure that you are looking at fundamentally sound companies.

Liquidity Ratios:  
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities  
Goal: Choose stocks with a current ratio >1, indicating the company can cover short-term obligations.  

Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities  
Goal: A higher quick ratio means a company can meet its short-term liabilities without relying on inventory sales.  

Leverage Ratios:  
Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Shareholders’ Equity  
Goal: Lower debt-to-equity ratios are preferred (e.g., below 1), indicating less reliance on debt.  

Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expenses  
Goal: Higher values (>2.5) suggest the company can easily cover its interest expenses.  

Profitability Ratios:  
Return on Equity (ROE) = Net Income / Shareholders’ Equity  
Goal: ROE > 15% suggests efficient management and profitability.  

Return on Assets (ROA) = Net Income / Total Assets  
Goal: Higher ROA indicates effective use of assets to generate profits.  

Gross Margin = (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue  
Goal: Select companies with consistently high margins, suggesting strong profitability.

## 2. Risk and Volatility Assessment
After filtering with ratios, assess the stock’s risk profile. This ensures that your portfolio will not be excessively volatile.

Beta:  
Goal: Compare the stock’s volatility with the market. A beta of 1 means the stock moves with the market, while beta > 1 implies more volatility. You can set thresholds for preferred volatility.

Standard Deviation and Variance:  
Goal: Measure the stock’s price fluctuations. The higher the standard deviation, the riskier the stock. You might prefer stocks with moderate volatility based on your risk tolerance.

## 3. Growth and Efficiency Assessment
Now that risk has been assessed, evaluate the company’s ability to grow efficiently by analyzing how well it manages its assets and generates sales.

Efficiency Ratios:  
Asset Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Total Assets  
Goal: Higher ratios indicate that the company is effectively using its assets to generate revenue.  

Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  
Goal: A high turnover rate indicates that inventory is selling quickly, which may be a positive sign.  

Trend Analysis:  
Goal: Examine long-term trends in revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth. Look for consistent upward trends that suggest growth potential. Visualize these trends with charts to spot patterns.

## 4. Profitability Forecasting: Time Value of Money (TVM) and Capital Budgeting
After evaluating current health, forecast potential returns from the stock.

Use discounted cash flow models to estimate the present value of future cash flows or dividends to evaluate whether the stock is undervalued or overvalued.  

Present Value (PV) and Future Value (FV):  
Goal: Use to calculate the time-adjusted value of cash flows.

Net Present Value (NPV):  
Formula:  
NPV = Σ{Ct/(1+r)^t} - C₀ = Σ from t=1 to n {Ct/(1+r)^t} - C₀  
NPV = Σ{1/(1+r)^t}Ct - C₀  

Goal: If NPV > 0, the stock is considered a good investment. Compare different investment opportunities using NPV to see which one offers better returns.  

Internal Rate of Return (IRR):  
Goal: The IRR is the rate that makes the NPV of the investment zero. Stocks with IRR > required rate of return are typically attractive.

## 5. Risk Mitigation and Sensitivity Testing
Stress-test the stock’s performance under various conditions to assess potential risks.

Sensitivity Analysis:  
Goal: Vary key inputs like sales growth, cost, or interest rates to see how changes affect profitability.  
For example, if costs rise by 10%, how will that impact profit margins or earnings?

Value at Risk (VaR):  
Goal: Estimate the maximum potential loss over a specified time period at a given confidence level (e.g., 95%).  
This gives you a statistical risk measure to avoid excessive losses.

## 6. Break-Even and Profitability Thresholds
Use profitability benchmarks to understand when the stock or company breaks even.

Break-Even Point (BEP):  
Formula: Break-Even Sales = Fixed Costs / (Sales Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)  
Goal: Knowing the BEP helps identify the sales volume needed to cover costs and start generating profit.

Cost-Volume-Profit (CVP) Analysis:  
Goal: Measure how changes in sales volume impact profits.  
This is useful for understanding the company’s ability to scale and manage profitability as conditions change.

## 7. Advanced Risk and Opportunity Assessment
For deeper analysis, simulate different market conditions and analyze the relationships between financial variables.

Monte Carlo Simulation:  
Goal: Simulate a wide range of potential outcomes based on different assumptions (e.g., market conditions, interest rates).  
This helps in assessing the robustness of an investment.

Regression Analysis:  
Goal: Use linear or multiple regression to assess the impact of various factors (e.g., interest rates, inflation) on stock prices or earnings growth.  
It’s helpful in understanding how external factors influence stock performance.

## 8. Optimization and Final Selection
After evaluating stocks, use optimization techniques to build a balanced portfolio that maximizes returns for a given level of risk.

Linear Programming:  
Goal: Optimize your portfolio by selecting stocks that maximize expected returns while minimizing risk,  
subject to constraints (e.g., capital limits, risk tolerance).

Capital Budgeting Techniques (NPV, IRR):  
Goal: Use NPV and IRR calculations to prioritize investments,  
selecting those with the highest potential profitability and alignment with your financial goals.
